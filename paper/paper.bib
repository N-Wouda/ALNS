    abstract = "Heuristics based on large neighborhood search have recently shown outstanding results in solving various transportation and scheduling problems. Large neighborhood search methods explore a complex neighborhood by use of heuristics. Using large neighborhoods makes it possible to find better candidate solutions in each iteration and hence traverse a more promising search path. Starting from the large neighborhood search method,we give an overview of very large scale neighborhood search methods and discuss recent variants and extensions like variable depth search and adaptive large neighborhood search.",

    abstractNote={Adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) is a useful framework for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems. As a metaheuristic, it consists of some components that must be tailored to the specific optimisation problem that is being solved, while other components are problem independent. The literature is sparse with respect to studies that aim to evaluate the relative merit of different alternatives for specific problem independent components. This paper investigates one such component, the move acceptance criterion in ALNS, and compares a range of alternatives. Through extensive computational testing, the alternative move acceptance criteria are ranked in three groups, depending on the performance of the resulting ALNS implementations. Among the best variants, we find versions of criteria based on simulated annealing, threshold acceptance, and record-to-record travel, with a version of the latter being consistently undominated by the others. Additional analyses focus on the search behavior, and multiple linear regression is used to identify characteristics of search behavior that are associated with good search performance.},
