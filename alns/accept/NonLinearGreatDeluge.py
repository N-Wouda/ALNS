class NonLinearGreatDeluge(GreatDeluge):
    """
    The Non-Linear Great Deluge (NLGD) criterion accepts solutions if the
    candidate solution has a value lower than a threshold (originally called
    the water level [1]). The initial threshold is computed as

    ``threshold = alpha * initial.objective()``

    where ``initial`` is the initial solution passed-in to ALNS.

    The non-linear GD variant was proposed by [2]. It differs from GD by using
    a non-linear updating scheme; see the ``_compute_threshold`` method for
    details. Moreover, candidate solutions that improve the current solution
    are always accepted.

    The implementation is based on the description in [2].

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha
        Factor used to compute the initial threshold. See [2] for details.
    beta
        Factor used to update the threshold. See [2] for details.
    gamma
        Factor used to update the threshold. See [2] for details.
    delta
        Factor used to update the threshold. See [2] for details.
