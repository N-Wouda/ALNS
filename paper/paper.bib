    abstract = "Heuristics based on large neighborhood search have recently shown outstanding results in solving various transportation and scheduling problems. Large neighborhood search methods explore a complex neighborhood by use of heuristics. Using large neighborhoods makes it possible to find better candidate solutions in each iteration and hence traverse a more promising search path. Starting from the large neighborhood search method,we give an overview of very large scale neighborhood search methods and discuss recent variants and extensions like variable depth search and adaptive large neighborhood search.",

    abstractNote={Adaptive large neighborhood search (ALNS) is a useful framework for solving difficult combinatorial optimisation problems. As a metaheuristic, it consists of some components that must be tailored to the specific optimisation problem that is being solved, while other components are problem independent. The literature is sparse with respect to studies that aim to evaluate the relative merit of different alternatives for specific problem independent components. This paper investigates one such component, the move acceptance criterion in ALNS, and compares a range of alternatives. Through extensive computational testing, the alternative move acceptance criteria are ranked in three groups, depending on the performance of the resulting ALNS implementations. Among the best variants, we find versions of criteria based on simulated annealing, threshold acceptance, and record-to-record travel, with a version of the latter being consistently undominated by the others. Additional analyses focus on the search behavior, and multiple linear regression is used to identify characteristics of search behavior that are associated with good search performance.},

    abstract = {The vehicle routing problem is one of the most studied combinatorial optimization topics, due to its practical importance and methodological interest. Yet, despite extensive methodological progress, many recent studies are hampered by the limited access to simple and efficient open-source solution methods. Given the sophistication of current algorithms, reimplementation is becoming a difficult and time-consuming exercise that requires extensive care for details to be truly successful. Against this background, we use the opportunity of this short paper to introduce a simple – open-source – implementation of the hybrid genetic search (HGS) specialized to the capacitated vehicle routing problem (CVRP). This state-of-the-art algorithm uses the same general methodology as Vidal et al. (2012) but also includes additional methodological improvements and lessons learned over the past decade of research. In particular, it includes an additional neighborhood called SWAP* which consists in exchanging two customers between different routes without an insertion in place. As highlighted in our study, an efficient exploration of SWAP* moves significantly contributes to the performance of local searches. Moreover, as observed in experimental comparisons with other recent approaches on the classical instances of Uchoa et al. (2017), HGS still stands as a leading metaheuristic regarding solution quality, convergence speed, and conceptual simplicity.}

    DOI={10.1006/jcph.1993.1010},
    abstractNote={In a former paper we introduced a very effective new general purpose optimization principle. We compared this method, which we called threshold accepting (TA), with the well-known simulated annealing (SA) method for discrete optimization. The empirical results demonstrated the superiority of the TA algorithm. In further experiments with the TA principle we discovered two new powerful optimization heuristics: The great deluge algorithm (GDA) and the record-to-record travel (RRT). These algorithms resemble in their structure the formerly studied TA and the SA method. The differences lie in their acceptance rules for worse intermediate solutions. Both, the GDA and the RRT, are essentially one-parameter algorithms; i.e., for the achievement of best possible performance, a good choice is necessary only for a single parameter. This is in contrast for instance to the classical AS algorithm, where it is necessary to choose carefully a certain sequence of parameters, the so-called annealing schedule. The quality of the computational results obtained so far by RRT and GDA shows that the new algorithms behave equally well as TA and thus a fortiori better than SA.},

    DOI={10.1007/s12532-021-00209-7},
    abstractNote={Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristics are among the most powerful but also most expensive heuristics for mixed integer programs (MIP). Ideally, a solver adaptively concentrates its limited computational budget by learning which LNS heuristics work best for the MIP problem at hand. To this end, this work introduces Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS) for MIP, a primal heuristic that acts as a framework for eight popular LNS heuristics such as Local Branching and Relaxation Induced Neighborhood Search (RINS). We distinguish the available LNS heuristics by their individual search spaces, which we call auxiliary problems. The decision which auxiliary problem should be executed is guided by selection strategies for the multi armed bandit problem, a related optimization problem during which suitable actions have to be chosen to maximize a reward function. In this paper, we propose an LNS-specific reward function to learn to distinguish between the available auxiliary problems based on successful calls and failures. A second, algorithmic enhancement is a generic variable fixing prioritization, which ALNS employs to adjust the subproblem complexity as needed. This is particularly useful for some LNS problems which do not fix variables by themselves. The proposed primal heuristic has been implemented within the MIP solver SCIP. An extensive computational study is conducted to compare different LNS strategies within our ALNS framework on a large set of publicly available MIP instances from the MIPLIB and Coral benchmark sets. The results of this simulation are used to calibrate the parameters of the bandit selection strategies. A second computational experiment shows the computational benefits of the proposed ALNS framework within the MIP solver SCIP.},
