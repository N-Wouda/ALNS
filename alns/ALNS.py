class ALNS:
    """
    Implements the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) algorithm.
    The implementation optimises for a minimisation problem, as explained
    in the text by Pisinger and Røpke (2010).

    Parameters
    ----------
    rnd_state
        Optional random state to use for random number generation. When
        passed, this state is used for operator selection and general
        computations requiring random numbers. It is also passed to the
        destroy and repair operators, as a second argument.

            The initial solution, as a State object.
        weight_scheme
            The weight scheme to use for updating the (adaptive) weights. See

        ------
