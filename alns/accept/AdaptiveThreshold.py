class AdaptiveThreshold:
    """
    The Adaptive Threshold (AT) criterion accepts solutions
    if the candidate solution has a value lower than an
    adaptive threshold. The adaptive threshold is computed as:

    ''adaptive_threshold =  best_solution +
    eta_parameter * (average_solution - best_solution)''

    where
    ``best_solution`` is the best solution received so far,
    ``average_solution`` is the average of the last
    ``gamma_parameter`` solutions received, and
    ``eta_parameter`` is a parameter between 0 and 1,
    the greater the value of
    ``eta_parameter``, the more likely it is that a solution
    will be accepted.

    Each time a new solution is received,
    the threshold is updated. The average solution
    and best solution are taken by the last "gamma_parameter"
    solutions received. If the number of solutions received
    is less than"gamma_parameter" then the threshold
    is updated with the average of all the solutions
    received so far.

    The implementation is based on the description of AT in [1].

    Parameters
    ----------
    eta: float
        Used to update/tune the threshold,
        the greater the value of ``eta_parameter``,
        the more likely it is that a solution will be accepted.
    gamma: int
        Used to update the threshold, the number of solutions
        received to compute the average & best solution.
