    "# The resource-constrained project scheduling problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The following explanation is largely based on [this paper](https://pms2020.sciencesconf.org/300164/document).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the RCPSP is to schedule a set of project activities $V = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\}$, such that the makespan of the project is minimised.\n",
    "Each activity $i \\in V$ has a duration $d_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "Precedence constraints impose that an activity $i \\in V$ can only start after all its predecessor activities have been completed.\n",
    "The precedence constraints are given by a set of edges $E \\subset V \\times V$, where $(i, j) \\in E$ means that $i$ must be completed before $j$ can commence.\n",
    "Resource constraints, on the other hand, impose that an activity can only be scheduled if sufficient resources are available.\n",
    "There are $K = \\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, m \\}$ renewable resources available, with $R_k$ indicating the availability of resource $k$.\n",
    "Each activity $i \\in V$ requires $r_{ik}$ units of resource $k$.\n",
    "A solution to the RCPSP is a schedule of activities $S = \\{ S_0, S_1, \\ldots, S_n \\}$, where $S_i$ is the starting time of activity $i$.\n",
    "The project starts at time $S_0 = 0$, and completes at $S_n$, where activities $0$ and $n$ are dummy activities that represent the start and completion of the project, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we solve an instance of the RCPSP using ALNS.\n",
    "In particular, we solve instance `j9041_6` of the [PSPLib](http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html) benchmark suite.\n",
    "This instance consists of 90 jobs, and four resources.\n",
    "The optimal makespan of this instance is known to be between 123 and 135."
