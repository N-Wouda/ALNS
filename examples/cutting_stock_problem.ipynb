    "The [cutting-stock problem (CSP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cutting_stock_problem) is well-known problem in operations research. Many different formulations exist, e.g. for the one-, two-, and even three-dimensional case. Here we solve an instance of the one-dimensional problem, obtained from the data [here](http://www.math.tu-dresden.de/~capad/cpd-ti.html#1D). It is known that the optimal solution for this problem achieves a wastage of only 74."

The ALNS package exposes the class ``State`` to describe a solution, with an ``objective()`` member that computes this solution's objective value. Using it, we may compute a simple initial solution, and then apply the ALNS algorithm."
