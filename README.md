This package offers a general, well-documented and tested
implementation of the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS)
meta-heuristic, based on the description given in [Pisinger and Ropke
(2010)][1]. It may be installed in the usual way as,

```
pip install alns
```

## How to use
The `alns` package exposes two classes, `ALNS` and `State`. The first
may be used to run the ALNS algorithm, the second may be subclassed to
store a solution state - all it requires is to define an `objective`
member function, returning an objective value.

The ALNS algorithm must be supplied with an acceptance criterion, to
determine the acceptance of a new solution state at each iteration.
An overview of common acceptance criteria is given in [Santini et al.
(2018)][3]. Several have already been implemented for you, in
`alns.criteria`,

- `HillClimbing`. The simplest acceptance criterion, hill-climbing
  solely accepts solutions improving the objective value.
- `RecordToRecordTravel`. This criterion only accepts solutions when
  the improvement meets some updating threshold.
- `SimulatedAnnealing`. This criterion accepts solutions when the
  scaled probability is bigger than some random number, using an
  updating temperature.

Each acceptance criterion inherits from `AcceptanceCriterion`, which may
be used to write your own.

### Examples
The `examples/` directory features some example notebooks showcasing
how the ALNS library may be used. Of particular interest are,

- The travelling salesman problem (TSP), [here][2]. We solve an
  instance of 131 cities to within 2.1% of optimality, using simple
  destroy and repair heuristics with a post-processing step.
- The cutting-stock problem (CSP), [here][4]. We solve an instance with
  180 beams over 165 distinct sizes to within 1.35% of optimality in
  only a very limited number of iterations.
