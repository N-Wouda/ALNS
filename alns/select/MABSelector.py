class MABSelector(OperatorSelectionScheme):
    """
    A selector that uses any multi-armed-bandit algorithm from MABWiser.

    This selector is a wrapper around the many multi-armed bandit algorithms
    available in the `MABWiser <https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser>`_
    library. Since ALNS operator selection can be framed as a
    multi-armed-bandit problem (where each [destroy, repair] operator pair is
    a bandit arm), this wrapper allows you to use a variety of existing
    multi-armed-bandit algorithms as operator selectors instead of
    having to reimplement them.

    Note that the supplied ``MAB`` object must be generated with the static
    method ``make_arms``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores
        A list of four non-negative elements, representing the rewards when the
        candidate solution results in a new global best (idx 0), is better than
        the current solution (idx 1), the solution is accepted (idx 2), or
        rejected (idx 3).
    mab
        A MABWiser MAB object that will be used to select the
        (destroy, repair) operator pairs. The arms of the ``mab`` object must
        be generated with the static method ``make_arms``.
    num_destroy
        Number of destroy operators.
    num_repair
        Number of repair operators.
    op_coupling
        Optional boolean matrix that indicates coupling between destroy and
        repair operators. Entry (i, j) is True if destroy operator i can be
        used together with repair operator j, and False otherwise.
    context_extractor
        Optional function that takes a ALNS State object and returns a context
        vector for that state that can be passed to a contextual MABWiser
        bandit. If the MAB algorithm supports it, this context will be used to
        help predict the next (destroy, repair) combination.
