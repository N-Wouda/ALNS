    "The travelling salesman problem (TSP) is a classic problem in operations research. It asks how to construct the minimum distance tour between a number of nodes, such that each node is visited once and the tour concludes at the starting city (that is, it forms a cycle). It is perhaps the best-known problem in the class of [NP-hard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness) problems.\n",

For the sake of exposition, we shall use one of the smaller data sets: the data from the XQF131 VLSI instance, made available [here](http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/tsp/vlsi/index.html#XQF131).
