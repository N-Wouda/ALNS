    "# The resource-constrained project scheduling problem\n",
    "\n",
    "The following explanation is largely based on [this paper](https://pms2020.sciencesconf.org/300164/document).\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the RCPSP is to schedule a set of project activities $V = \\{ 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, n \\}$, such that the makespan of the project is minimised.\n",
    "Each activity $i \\in V$ has a duration $d_i \\in \\mathbb{N}$.\n",
    "Precedence constraints impose that an activity $i \\in V$ can only start after all its predecessor activities have been completed.\n",
    "The precedence constraints are given by a set of edges $E \\subset V \\times V$, where $(i, j) \\in E$ means that $i$ must be completed before $j$ can commence.\n",
    "Resource constraints, on the other hand, impose that an activity can only be scheduled if sufficient resources are available.\n",
    "There are $K = \\{ 1, 2, \\ldots, m \\}$ renewable resources available, with $R_k$ indicating the availability of resource $k$.\n",
    "Each activity $i \\in V$ requires $r_{ik}$ units of resource $k$.\n",
    "\n",
    "A solution to the RCPSP is a schedule of activities $S = \\{ S_0, S_1, \\ldots, S_n \\}$, where $S_i$ is the starting time of activity $i$.\n",
    "The project starts at time $S_0 = 0$, and completes at $S_n$, where activities $0$ and $n$ are dummy activities that represent the start and completion of the project, respectively.\n",
    "Define by $A(S, t) = \\{ i \\in V \\mid S_i \\le t \\text{ and } S_i + d_i \\ge t \\}$ the set of activities in $S$ that are active at time $t$.\n",
    "The RCPCP can then be formulated as the following optimisation problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\min         & S_n \\\\\n",
    "    \\text{s.t. } & S_i + d_i \\le S_j \\qquad \\forall (i, j) \\in E \\\\\n",
    "                 & \\sum_{i \\in A(S, t)} r_{ik} \\le R_k \\qquad \\forall t \\ge 0,~\\forall k \\in K \\\\\n",
    "                 & S_i \\ge 0 \\qquad \\forall i \\in V\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "\n",

    "In this notebook, we solve an instance of the RCPSP using ALNS.\n",
    "In particular, we solve instance `j9041_6` of the [PSPLib](http://www.om-db.wi.tum.de/psplib/library.html) benchmark suite.\n",
    "This instance consists of 90 jobs, and four resources.\n"
