class AlphaUCB(OperatorSelectionScheme):
    """
    The :math:`\\alpha`-UCB (upper confidence bound) bandit scheme adapted
    from Hendel (2022).

    The action space :math:`A` is defined as each pair of (destroy, repair)
    operators that is allowed by the operator coupling matrix. The
    :math:`\\alpha`-UCB algorithm plays the following action in each iteration
    :math:`t`, computed as

    .. math::

        Q(t) = \\arg \\max_{a \\in A} \\left\\{ \\bar{r}_a (t - 1)
               + \\sqrt{\\frac{\\alpha \\ln(1 + t)}{T_a (t - 1)}} \\right\\},

    where :math:`T_a(t - 1)` is the number of times action :math:`a` has been
    played, and :math:`\\bar r_a(t - 1)` is the average reward of action
    :math:`a`, both in the first :math:`t - 1` iterations. The value that is
    maximised over the actions :math:`a \\in A` consists of the average reward
    term :math:`\\bar r_a(t - 1)` and an exploration bonus depending on
    :math:`t` and the number of times :math:`a` has been played.

    See :meth:`~alns.select.AlphaUCB.AlphaUCB.update` for details on how the
    average reward :math:`\\bar r_a` is updated.

    .. note::

        The average reward :math:`\\bar r_a(0)` of each action :math:`a \\in A`
        is initialised to 1. The ``scores`` list passed into the
        :math:`\\alpha`-UCB scheme should be 'reasonable' with respect to this
        default.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores
        A list of four non-negative elements, representing the rewards when the
        candidate solution results in a new global best (idx 0), is better than
        the current solution (idx 1), the solution is accepted (idx 2), or
        rejected (idx 3).
    alpha
        The :math:`\\alpha \\in [0, 1]` parameter controls how much exploration
        is performed. Values of :math:`\\alpha`  near one result in much
        exploration, whereas values of :math:`\\alpha` nearer to zero result in
        more exploitation of good operator pairs. Typically,
        :math:`\\alpha \\le 0.1` is a good choice.
    num_destroy
        Number of destroy operators.
    num_repair
        Number of repair operators.
    op_coupling
        Optional boolean matrix that indicates coupling between destroy and
        repair operators. Entry (i, j) is True if destroy operator i can be
        used together with repair operator j, and False otherwise.
