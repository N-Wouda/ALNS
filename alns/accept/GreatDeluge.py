class GreatDeluge(AcceptanceCriterion):
    """
    The Great Deluge (GD) criterion accepts solutions if the candidate solution
    has a value lower than a threshold (originally called the water level [1]).
    The initial threshold is computed as

    ``threshold = alpha * initial.objective()``

    where ``initial`` is the initial solution passed-in to ALNS.

    The threshold is updated in each iteration as

    ``threshold = threshold - beta * (threshold - candidate.objective())``

    The implementation is based on the description of GD in [2].

    Parameters
    ----------
    alpha
        Factor used to compute the initial threshold
    beta
        Factor used to update the threshold
