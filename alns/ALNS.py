        Implements the adaptive large neighbourhood search (ALNS) algorithm.
        The implementation optimises for a minimisation problem, as explained
        in the text by Pisinger and Røpke (2010).

        Parameters
        ----------
        rnd_state : rnd.RandomState
            Optional random state to use for random number generation. When
            passed, this state is used for operator selection and general
            computations requiring random numbers. It is also passed to the
            destroy and repair operators, as a second argument.

        Parameters
        ----------
        initial_solution : State
            The initial solution, as a State object.
        weights: array_like
            A list of four positive elements, representing the weight updates

        operator_decay : float
            The operator decay parameter, as a float in the unit interval.
        criterion : AcceptanceCriterion
            The acceptance criterion to use for candidate states. See also
            the `alns.criteria` module for an overview.
        iterations : int
            The number of iterations. Default 10000.
        collect_stats : bool
            Should statistics be collected during iteration? Default True, but
            may be turned off for long runs to reduce memory consumption.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            When the parameters do not meet requirements.

        -------
        Result
