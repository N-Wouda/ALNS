    "# The capacitated vehicle routing problem\n",
    "The vehicle routing problem (VRP) is one of the most studied problems in operations research. Given a fleet of vehicles and customers, the goal is to construct a set of routes such that each customer is visited exactly once, while minimizing the total distance traveled by the vehicles. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite decades of research, the VRP (and variants thereof) remains a very hard problem to solve and new algorithms continue to be developed to address this problem. A related and interesting fact is that ALNS was originally proposed by [Ropke and Pisinger (2006)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.1050.0135?casa_token=-DeLGU-Nr_4AAAAA:hTPxhhAn8TRi5h8p5LdQ_r-tQ1j4lCD4-K4ZR4gSi0e9O6reL6vcyfC0NZmkW1hoQGkUEjcumwH6) to solve many variants of the vehicle routing problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we use ALNS to solve the most famous VRP variant: the *Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)*. The CVRP can be described using an undirected graph $G=(V,E)$, where $V$ is the vertex set and $E$ is the edge set. The vertex set $V$ is partitioned into $V=\\{0\\} \\cup V_c$, where $0$ is the depot and $V_c=\\{1, \\dots, n\\}$ denotes the set of $n$ customers. Each customer $i \\in V_c$ has a demand $q_i > 0$. A distance $d_{ij}$ is associated with each edge $(i, j) \\in E$. We assume that we have an unlimited fleet of homogeneous vehicles with capacity $Q$ located at the depot. A feasible solution to the CVRP is a set of routes, each served by a single vehicle, such that each customer is served exactly once and none of the routes exceed the vehicle capacity. The goal is to minimize the total distance traveled."

    "## Slack-induced substring removal\n",
    "The simple destroy and repair operator from above work fine, but there are better destroy and repair operators for CVRP. One example is the *Slack Induction by Substring Removal (SISR)* method proposed by [Christiaens and Vanden Berghe (2020)](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/trsc.2019.0914?casa_token=lPUXU1Ax8PIAAAAA:yTE9Pu6L9QGPRu_vt-ZMHF0AZvL9gV0fNS4QAUTOJboQcgTVyOR9_RTbm9rZcImyKI4GUW9pLv1j). SISR obtains state-of-the-art results using a destroy operator that, instead of removing random customers, removes partial routes (called *strings*) that are all located near each other. Moreover, a blinking feature is added to the greedy repair operator, where certain insertion checks are skipped. For more details, we refer to the paper.\n",

    "In this notebook we implemented two heuristics for the CVRP, using the ALNS meta-heuristic framework. The first heuristic used a random customer destroy operator and we obtained a solution which is 10% worse than the best known solution. The second heuristic used a destroy operator which removes strings arround a randomly selected customer and we obtained a solution that is only 3% worse than the best known solution. \n",
