class MABSelector(OperatorSelectionScheme):
    """
    A selector that uses any multi-armed-bandit algorithm from MABWiser.

    This selector is a wrapper around the many multi-armed bandit algorithms
    available in the `MABWiser <https://github.com/fidelity/mabwiser>`_
    library. Since ALNS operator selection can be framed as a
    multi-armed-bandit problem (where each [destroy, repair] operator pair is
    a bandit arm), this wrapper allows you to use a variety of existing
    multi-armed-bandit algorithms as operator selectors instead of
    having to reimplement them.

    Note that if the provided learning policy is a contextual bandit
    algorithm, your state class must provide a `get_context` function that
    returns a context vector for the current state.

    Parameters
    ----------
    scores
        A list of four non-negative elements, representing the rewards when the
        candidate solution results in a new global best (idx 0), is better than
        the current solution (idx 1), the solution is accepted (idx 2), or
        rejected (idx 3).
    num_destroy
        Number of destroy operators.
    num_repair
        Number of repair operators.
    learning_policy
        A MABWiser learning policy that acts as an operator selector. See the
        MABWiser documentation for a list of available learning policies.
    neighborhood_policy
        The neighborhood policy that MABWiser should use. Only available for
        contextual learning policies. See the MABWiser documentation for a
        list of available neighborhood policies.
    seed
        A seed that will be passed to the underlying MABWiser object.
    op_coupling
        Optional boolean matrix that indicates coupling between destroy and
        repair operators. Entry (i, j) is True if destroy operator i can be
        used together with repair operator j, and False otherwise.
